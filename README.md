# 📊 PyCitySchools: School Performance Analysis with Pandas

## 📝 Overview
This project involves using **Pandas** to analyze school and standardized test performance across a city’s school district. The goal is to help school officials make informed decisions regarding budgets, priorities, and educational strategies.

Using **Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook**, we analyze test results across schools, compute key performance metrics, and identify trends that impact student success.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

### 1️⃣ **District Summary**
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math and reading scores
- % passing math, reading, and overall passing

### 2️⃣ **School Summary**
- School type (Public/Charter)
- Total students per school
- Total school budget and per-student spending
- Average test scores
- Percentage of students passing math, reading, and both

### 3️⃣ **Performance Rankings**
- **Top 5 performing schools** based on overall passing percentage
- **Bottom 5 performing schools** based on overall passing percentage

### 4️⃣ **Performance Breakdown**
- Math & Reading scores by grade level (9th–12th)
- Performance analysis based on **school spending** (per student)
- Performance analysis based on **school size**
- Performance analysis based on **school type**

### 5️⃣ **Written Analysis & Observations**
- Summary of key findings
- Two major takeaways from the data
